## reading03 HTML


### A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of asite. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

### The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for: ●● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

The <article> element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated

The <aside> element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an <article>
element or not

The <section> element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.

The purpose of the <hgroup>
element is to group together a
set of one or more <h1> through
<h6> elements so that they are
treated as one single heading.

You already met the <figure>
element in Chapter 5 when we
looked at images. It can be used
to contain any content that is
referenced from the main flow of
an article (not just images).

If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be

can add the text between these
characters:

id attribute 
Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
It is important that no two
elements on the same page
have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).
